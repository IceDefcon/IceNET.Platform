# ---==[ CURRENT ]==---

1. Continue kernel module Development
2. SPI must work as a thread
3. Application must talk to SPI via thread 

# ---==[ DEVELOPMENT ]==---

1. Upgrade CPU platform :: Cortex-M4 >> Cortex A8
2. Further CPU upgrade 	:: Cortex-A53 Quad and Cortex-R5 Dual Real time processor
3. Further FPGA upgrade :: Ultra96-V2 with Ultrascale+ MPSOC
4. Airshark Development Highly Required ---> 4G LTE Core Boards
