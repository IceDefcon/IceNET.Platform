lsmem: This command displays information about the system's physical memory (RAM), including its size, range, and other attributes.

lsof: It lists open files and the processes that have them open. Useful for identifying which processes are using specific files.

lsattr: It displays the attributes of files and directories, including special permissions, file capabilities, and more.

lscpu: This command provides detailed information about the CPU (central processing unit), including its architecture, model, cache sizes, and supported features.

lslocks: It lists information about file and record locks held by processes.

lsmod: This command lists the currently loaded kernel modules (device drivers) on the system.

lspgpot: This command is not a standard Linux command, and its purpose is unclear. It may be specific to your system or a custom command.

lsblk: It displays information about block devices, such as hard drives and partitions, including their names, sizes, and mount points.

lsinitramfs: It lists the contents of the initial RAM file system (initramfs), which is used during the boot process.

lslogins: This command provides information about currently logged-in users on the system.

lsns: It lists the namespaces available on the system.

lsusb: This command displays information about USB devices connected to the system, including their vendor and product IDs, device classes, and speeds.
